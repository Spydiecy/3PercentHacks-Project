# Futureverse Auth Integration Fix

This document explains the fix for the Futureverse Auth integration error and how to properly set up wallet connection.

## Problem

The original error was:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
WalletContext.tsx:78 Error connecting wallet: TypeError: authClient.signIn is not a function
```

## Solution

### 1. Updated WalletContext.tsx

The main issues were:
- Incorrect `signIn()` method call - it requires parameters
- Missing proper error handling for optional `signOut` function
- Incorrect auth client configuration

**Fixed configuration:**
```typescript
const authClient = new FutureverseAuthClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FUTUREVERSE_CLIENT_ID || '2qC_LOMj3oHhri4XpJL2X',
  environment: (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FUTUREVERSE_ENVIRONMENT as any) || 'development',
  redirectUri: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? `${window.location.origin}/dashboard/` : 'http://localhost:3000/dashboard/'
})
```

**Fixed signIn call:**
```typescript
await signIn({ type: 'eoa' })  // EOA = Externally Owned Account
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Created `.env.local` with necessary configuration:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FUTUREVERSE_CLIENT_ID=2qC_LOMj3oHhri4XpJL2X
NEXT_PUBLIC_FUTUREVERSE_ENVIRONMENT=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=81d0f73d-93d0-4cb0-b7ae-bce20587e79b
```

### 3. Updated My Transactions Page

- Integrated with the WalletContext instead of direct MetaMask calls
- Uses Futureverse wallet state for transaction loading
- Properly handles connected wallet address

### 4. Test Page

Created `/dashboard/wallet-test` page to verify the integration works:
- Shows connection status
- Displays wallet address when connected
- Shows user session data
- Provides connect/disconnect functionality

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the wallet test page:**
   Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/wallet-test`

3. **Test wallet connection:**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Follow the Futureverse Auth flow
   - Verify the wallet address appears
   - Check that the connection status shows as "Connected"

4. **Test in My Transactions page:**
   Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/evm/my-transactions` and verify:
   - The "Connect Wallet" button uses Futureverse Auth
   - Connected wallet address is used for API calls
   - Transaction data loads properly

## Key Components

### WalletContext.tsx
- Provides centralized wallet state management
- Handles Futureverse Auth integration
- Manages connection/disconnection flow

### ConnectWalletButton.tsx
- UI component for wallet connection
- Shows connected address when authenticated
- Provides disconnect functionality

### My Transactions Page
- Loads transaction data using connected wallet
- Integrates with Rootscan API
- Shows transaction history and details

## Dependencies

The following packages are required:
```json
{
  "@futureverse/auth-react": "^4.2.2",
  "@futureverse/auth-ui": "^0.13.3",
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.80.0",
  "wagmi": "^2.15.4",
  "viem": "^2.30.6"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Auth client not found error:**
   - Ensure client ID is correct in environment variables
   - Check that the redirect URI matches your development URL

2. **signIn not a function:**
   - Verify you're calling `signIn({ type: 'eoa' })` with parameters
   - Make sure you're inside the FutureverseAuthProvider

3. **400 Bad Request:**
   - Check that your client ID is registered with Futureverse
   - Ensure redirect URI is whitelisted in your Futureverse app settings

## Next Steps

1. Register your own Futureverse client ID for production
2. Update environment variables for production deployment
3. Add error handling for network failures
4. Implement wallet-specific features (signatures, transactions)
5. Add support for multiple wallet types if needed
